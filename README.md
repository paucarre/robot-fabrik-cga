# Introduction

- Lie Group Theory
    - [A micro Lie theory for state estimation in robotics](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.01537.pdf)

# Setup
Currently only **Ubuntu** is supported, but **PR**s to support other Linux distributions
are welcomed but active efforts will be put on dockerizing the solution.

To set up the environment run:
```bash
source ./bin/install-env.sh
```

To run unit tests:
```bash
make test
```
